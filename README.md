# JSatOrb project: Dockerisation module

This JSatOrb module is dedicated to the JSatOrb servers dockerisation.
It contains all thge information needed to produce the various Docker images and the Docker compose which runs them all.

All Docker images run into a Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64 bit environment, which is the JSatOrb target platform.

The Linux free edition of Docker is the Community Edition (CE).


## Uninstalling old Docker versions

To uninstall a possible previous Docker installation, run the command:
```
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```


## Installing Docker

---

___This whole paragraph ("Installing Docker"), except the last part ("Post-installation steps")  is an extract of the repository setup section from [this Docker documentation webpage.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository#install-using-the-repository)___

---

### Set up the repository

1. Update the `apt` package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```
$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
```

2. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Verify that you now have the key with the fingerprint `9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88`, by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint.

```
$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

pub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [SCEA]
        9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
uid           [ unknown] Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
sub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [S]
```

3. Use the following command to set up the stable repository. To add the nightly or test repository, add the word nightly or test (or both) after the word stable in the commands below. Learn about nightly and test channels.

---

**NOTE**

The lsb_release -cs sub-command below returns the name of your Ubuntu distribution, such as xenial. Sometimes, in a distribution like Linux Mint, you might need to change $(lsb_release -cs) to your parent Ubuntu distribution. For example, if you are using Linux Mint Tessa, you could use bionic. Docker does not offer any guarantees on untested and unsupported Ubuntu distributions.

---

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository \
    "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) \
    stable"
```    

#### Install Docker Engine

1. Update the `apt` package index, and install the _latest version_ of Docker Engine and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

```
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

---

**Got multiple Docker repositories ?**

If you have multiple Docker repositories enabled, installing or updating without specifying a version in the apt-get install or apt-get update command always installs the highest possible version, which may not be appropriate for your stability needs.

---

2. To install a specific version of Docker Engine, list the available versions in the repo, then select and install:

    a. List the versions available in your repo:

```
$ apt-cache madison docker-ce

    docker-ce | 5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages
    docker-ce | 5:18.09.0~3-0~ubuntu-xenial | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages
    docker-ce | 18.06.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu       | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages
    docker-ce | 18.06.0~ce~3-0~ubuntu       | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  xenial/stable amd64 Packages

```

   b. Install a specific version using the version string from the second column, for example, `5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial`.

```
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION_STRING> docker-ce-cli=<VERSION_STRING> containerd.io
```

3. Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

```
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.

Docker Engine is installed and running. The `docker` group is created but no users are added to it. You need to use `sudo` to run Docker commands. Continue to `Linux postinstall` to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration steps.

#### Upgrade Docker Engine

To upgrade Docker Engine, first run `sudo apt-get update`, then follow the installation instructions, choosing the new version you want to install.

#### Post-installation steps

##### Proxy setup

---

NOTE

The information given in this paragraph is an adaptation fom [this Docker documentation webpage]().

---

Install ca-certificates package if it's not already available.
```
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
```

Ask your network administrator for the proxy's CA certificate and append them to the file
```
/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

Start the Docker daemon with the command
```
HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy:port/ dockerd
```

___Remark: `username` and `password@` are optional and are only needed if your proxy requires authentication.___




If the previous Docker successfull installation step above failed (with the running of the Hello-world image), you may configure your proxy.  
To do so, follow the steps below:

- Edit your docker file: `sudo vi /etc/default/docker`
- Add your proxy settings:
```
export http_proxy="http://[YOUR_PROXY_URL]]:3128/"
export https_proxy="http://[YOUR_PROXY_URL]:3128/"
export no_proxy="[YOUR_PROXY_URL_SUFFIX]"
```
- Restart the Docker daemon: `sudo service docker restart`
